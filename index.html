            <div><p><strong>What:</strong> I added some color to the nav (on hover), some buttons and all the h1 (shadow). I moved the form to the contact page. I've also added javascript
              validation to the contact form. I added a slideshow to the home page. I've cleaned up the media rules and made the rules work properly. I changed every font-size
              from % to em, and removed every .0% from the css. I made both the jackets page and the jacket info page better/cleaner.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>How:</strong> I added color to the nav(a) on hover by changing the color on :hover in the css. I moved the form from their own page by copy pasting the form over to the
              contact page. I added javascript validation to the form by making the script and linking it up to the form on submit. I added a image slider by getting the slider from
              the project exam and designing it based on the current page. I cleaned up the media rules by moving them down to the bottom of the css and made them all go in a single
              media rule insted of separate. I made the media rules work properly by changing them so they would work both on a computer screen and mobile - not just mobile.
              I changed every font-size from % to em by changing the % to em and making the em as close to the original % size as possible. I removed the .0% from the css, by changing
              them from .0% to 0. I made the jackets page cleaner looking by adding a background-color, more margin and more padding. I did the same for the jacket info page, but I also
              aligned the text to the div by adding overflow-wrap (break-work) and text-align (justify). I also aligned the images on the jacket info page by adding display (block) to
              the img in the css.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>Why:</strong> I added some color on the page based on feedback. I personally like the grayscale look, but I can agree that this page was missing a bit of color. I moved the
              form from its own page to the contact page itself based on feedback, but also to make it more accessible instead of linking it threw a button. I added javascript validation
              to the form because it was missing rules in general but also to add some function to the page. And if this was a active page, the contact form would need rules before
              submitting information. I added a slideshow to the home page considering a headline and some text doesn't attract users to a page. The home page was missing something, and I
              think a slideshow was the correct alternative. I cleaned up the media rules to make it easier to read both for me and others. I made them work both for computer and mobile so
              the page would be more responsive to different windows/screens, not only based on device. I changed every font-size from % to em based on feedback but also to have a better
              sizing bethod for the text, considering em is a relative font-sizing. I removed every .0% based on feedback, but also considering that they where only there to prepare for
              furute changes. I made the jacket/jacket info pages cleaner solely based on looks. The jacket/jacket info pages didn't look that great before - but added some color to the background
              and more margin/padding helped a lot with the design.

            <div><p><strong>What:</strong> I've removed the explore, spaces and events text-boxes on the home page.
              I've also made the main container smaller. I've changed the font-family of h1, h2 and p to futura bold and souvenir.
              I have removed every .0% from the css, and changed the font-sizes from % to em. I removed the scrollbars from the text-boxes on the page,
              and made the divs larger in width. I've made the page description longer and added different titles to every page.
              I changed the animated lines on the page to still lines, but made the lines different colors on different pages.
              I've added shadow on h1 with different color, depending on what page the user is viewing. I've added a slideshow to the spaces page, and
              a fullscreen function to the images on the events page. I've also cleaned up the html.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>How:</strong> I removed the explore, spaces and events text-boxes by removing them from the html file. I made the main container smaller by
              making the max-width smaller in px. I've changed the font-family for h1, h2 and p by changing the font-family for each of the text styles.
              I removed the .0% by changing the .0% to 0. I changed the font-sizes from % to em, by changing the % to em and made the em similar in size to the previous % sizing.
              I removed the scrollbars from the divs by removing overflow scroll from the css, I then made the divs larger in width by changing the max-width.
              I made the page description longer by changing the meta for the different pages, and I changed the title on each page by changing the title for every page.
              I've removed the animated lines on the page, by removing the animation in the css, and made a whole new div with still lines. I also added different classes for each
              page, so the color would change, depending on what page the user is on. I did the same with the font-shadows for the h1 on each page.
              I've added a image slider on the spaces page and a fullscreen function on the events page, by copying my work from the project exam. I made some changed to the css,
              so it would match the website, including color change for the buttons on the image slider and different size for the fullscreen view.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>Why:</strong> I removed the explore, spaces and the events text-boxes considering the project was not supposed to include any lorem text. I made the main
              container smaller so it would fit better on the site/look better. I changed the font-family based on feedback. I removed the .0% based on feedback and that
              the lines where only supposed to be ready for change if needed (but they no longer are). I changed the font-size from % to em based on feedback but also after
              looking up the reason why. It's better to use a relative sizing for the fonts. I've added a longer meta description based on feedback but also to make the page
              more user-friendly for every user. I made the page titles unique for each based on each page, but also because I forgot to do this previously. I replaced the animated
              lines with still lines cause I found them too distracting, and it looked cleaner with still lines changing color based on viewed page. I added some shadow color to the
              h1 to make up for the removing of the animated lines, to make it more appealing for the younger audience without making it unappealing for the older audience.
              I added a image slider on the spaces page, to gather all the images in one place on the page. It looks cleaner and it's easier for the users to find
              the images, instead of having them on the bottom of the page. I added a fullscreen function to the images on the events page to give the user the option to view the
              images fullscreen if needed. I cleaned up the html based on feedback, but also to make easier for both me and others to read.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>What:</strong> I've removed the lower to higher opacity on hover on the nav(a). I have added a custom scrollbar for the website. I've changed the form
              error(s) and okay(s) text-size from % to em, and also made the text-size bigger. I've changed h1, h2 and p font-sizes from % to em. I have changed the
              category design of the page. I have added a gradient background to the footer, form button and per-page button. I have also added a back button to the
              blog specific page. I have removed the php folder, and also added a longer alt to the images on the blog specific page.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>How:</strong> I removed the lower to higher opacity on the nav(a) on hover by removing the lines from the css. I added a custom scrollbar by using webkit-scrollbar,
              then giving the code styling that fit the page better. I changed the error(s) and okay(s) messages text-size from % to em by changing it in the css. I also made the
              text bigger by giving the text a larger em size than the original % size. I changed the h1, h2 and p from % to em, by changing this in the css - I tried matching the
              original % size to the em. I changed the category div design by giving the div a :hover design as well - I made the img only display on hover, and added the title to the post
              in the div by adding a p in the script linking to the json data title. I added color gradient to the footer, form button and per-page button by using linear-gradient on the
              background in the css. I added a back button to the blog specific page by making a div, then adding a link back to the blog page. I also styled the back button class to match the page.
              I removed the php folder by simple deleting it from the website folder. I added a longer and better alt to the blog specific images by adding a alt text to the images on wordpress, and
              then linking the new alt to the images in the blog specific script.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>Why:</strong> I removed the lower to higher opacity on hover (nav(a)) because it was difficult to see the link text but also because it didn't look as good.
              I added a custom scrollbar because it looked cleaner on the page than the original/default scrollbar. I changed the error(s) and the okay(s) messages font-size from % to em because of
              previous feedback. I made the error/okay messages bigger because it made it easier to read for every user. I changed the h1, h2 and p from % to em because of previous feedbacks, but also
              to make the font-size relative. I changed the category design because the previous design look a lot like the recent posts design, and I wanted to make it different. I added gradient to
              the footer, form button and per-page button solely becuase of looks. I added a back button to the blog specific page to make the user experience better. By adding a back button it was
              easier to get back to the blog page than using the navigation bar on top. I removed the php folder because it wasn't in use. I added a longer/better alt to the images for users who are
              in need of the alt text to know what the images are displaying.
